Katie Guo's Data Science Projects


1. Marketing Analytics (RFM, Clustering, Segmentation, A/B Testing, Data Visualization)

• RFM Analysis: Performed RFM analysis on 50,000+ customer transactions, calculated recency, frequency, and monetary metrics, and segmented customers to implement loyalty rewards for super users, win-back discounts for churned segments, and onboarding offers for the new

• K-means Clustering: Applied K-Means clustering on scaled RFM features, chose optimal number of clusters through Elbow method, evaluated clustering performance through Silhouette score, segmented customers into actionable groups for personalized campaign targeting like VIP offer

• A/B Testing: Designed and executed A/B testing for promotional campaigns across customer segments; measured conversion rates, average spend, and retention, identified statistically significant improvements, and optimized incentives, resulting in increased retention rate and ROI

This project applies RFM analysis to a synthetic marketing dataset to segment customers by recency, frequency, and value, then uses clustering to identify distinct cohorts. Each segment informs tailored campaigns, optimizing messages, channels, and offers. An A/B testing framework evaluates impact on conversions, retention, and revenue across segments, while dashboards visualize segment profiles, campaign performance, and ROI. The workflow emphasizes reproducibility, with a robust data pipeline, labeled code, and a reusable notebook adaptable to real-world datasets. Deliverables include a deployable model, segment-focused dashboards, and practical deployment guidelines.
